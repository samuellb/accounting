    add-account [-c hash-of-borken-record] name of account
        
        adds a new account. -c can be used to correct spelling if you have
        hash of an old account record.
    
    add-trans   [-c hash-of-borken-record] [-m text] account1 D200 account2 C150 account3 C50...

        adds a new transaction. -m sets the message, and if it's left out
        your editor will be started like GIT does. After that the accounts
        and amounts follow. In this example account1 is debited with 200
        more "money units" (you can use anything, but probably cents is a
        good idea because only integers are allowed).
    
    balance [-d date] [regex]
    
        calculates the balance for accounts that match regex. If date is
        given then the balance at that date is shown instead of the current
        balance.
    
    list-accounts  [regex]
    
        list accounts that match regex, or all if no regex is given.
    
    list-transactions [-m regex] [-a regex]
    
        list accounts where the name or account matches regex.
