How it works
------------

The system works with a large log file that is hard to tamper with
because:

  1) each record has a hash of all previous records
  2) each record has a digital signature of the hash (maybe not...)
  3) only append operations are allowed by the software
     (unless it's modified by the user)

Log format in EBNF
------------------

Skip down to the next section if you prefer examples!

(* The log consists of "records" that contain either a new transaction 
   or a new account definition. *)
log := { record, "\n" } ;

space character := " " | "\n" ;
sep := ";", { space character } ;

(* Data types *)
nonzero digit := ? 1-9 ?
digit := ? 1..9 ? ;
positive integer := nonzero digit, { digit } ;
integer := [ "-" ], positive integer;
timestamp := ? UNIX timestamp ? ;
date := ? ISO date, such as 2010-12-31 ? ;

record := record data, sep, record timestamp, sep, correction back pointer, sep, hash ;
record data := named account | transaction ;
record timestamp := timestamp ;
correction back pointer := "-" | hash ;
hash := ? SHA-256 of all data before the hash, with spaces in separators removed ? ;

named account := "ACCOUNT", sep,
                 (asset | debt | revenue | expense), sep,
                 account name ;
asset := "ASSET" ;
debt := "DEBT" ;
revenue := "REVENUE" ;
expense := "EXPENSE" ;
account name := string ;

transaction := "TRANSACTION", sep,
               transaction number, sep,
               transaction date, sep,
               transaction text, sep,
               { balance change } ;
transaction number := integer ;
transaction date := date ;
transaction text := string ;
balance change := { account name, sep, amount, sep };
amount := ( debit | credit ), positive integer;
debet := "D" ;
credet := "C" ;


Examples
--------

Some hashes are left out because I was lazy.

ACCOUNT; ASSET; Kassa;                       1294864885; -; 408ecb0e591b90a539b633ce2358dc449b3f694c2baf866b65386a0b552c9d89
ACCOUNT; ASSET; Bank;                        1294864885; -; 76fd7b1725e569f309ad69c6a3d0ff7edab17b22b68f9080da5d4dfa14adbb63
ACCOUNT; DEBT;  Eget kapitlal                1294864885; -; b584dc53a86f8a4684abb4c1175d22fa635ad9159b5ccd34875c2294c3bfe507
TRANSACTION;   1;  2011-01-12;  Egen ins√§ttning;  Bank; D5000;  Eget kapitlal; K5000;           1294865621; -; hash....
ACCOUNT; DEBT;  Eget kapital;                1294865738; b584dc53a86f8a4684abb4c1175d22fa635ad9159b5ccd34875c2294c3bfe507; hash...


Here we create three accounts first. Note that the third one is 
misspelled. Then we do a transaction from "Eget kapital" to "Bank".
D stands for Debit and C for Credit. Finally we correct the third
record with the fifth record (it kind of overwrites it, but the old one 
is still kept). This is accomplished with the "Correction" field, which 
is left out ("-") in all other records.
